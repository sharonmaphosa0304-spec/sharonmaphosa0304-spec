I am a detail-driven and analytical student who loves working with numbers, solving problems, and transforming messy data into organized insights. I enjoy taking a real-world business problem, identifying the root issue, and applying structured data analysis to answer key questions.

I am currently in my 3rd year of studying **Quantitative Risk Management**, where I work with statistical concepts, data modeling, and analytical reasoning. I’m actively building my portfolio to transition into a **Junior Data Analyst** role.

## 🔍 What I Focus On

I use data to answer business questions such as:

### ✅ “Which products bring the most value to the business?”
By analyzing **sales trends**, calculating **KPIs**, and identifying **top-performing items**, I help businesses understand where growth is coming from.

---

### ✅ “How can we improve operational efficiency?”
By cleaning operational/booking data and identifying inconsistencies or bottlenecks, I help improve **workflow accuracy** and **resource allocation**.

---

### ✅ “What customer behaviors can we use to predict demand?”
Using historical data and simple statistical analysis, I identify **patterns, seasonality, and anomalies** that support better decision-making.
